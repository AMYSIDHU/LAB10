                                their project. The client will be able to enter their contact information in order to create
                                an account to access the system. Likewise, the staff will be able to enter the system
                                using a username and password in order to access a variety of different features that
                                will allow the client to stay in the loop regarding their project. The system will have a Calendar feature that staff will rely on to check upcoming
                                projects and see who is assigned to them. The system will show what tasks need to be
                                completed and what the job progression is looking like. A picture upload section where
                                staff can upload pictures at many different stages of the project so the client can view to
                                see how the project is coming along such as baseline, prep, pipe replacement, drywall
                                work and the finished project picture. It will also include a communication platform for
                                employees to employer and customers to the business.
                                The addition to the following requirements, the system will allow staff to view projects in
